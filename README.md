# Description
This is a project for the course DAT205 Advanced Computer Graphics given at Chalmers University of Technology 2019.
The main part of the project is procedural architectural generation.

The code is based on code from the repository located at [https://gitlab.com/chalmerscg/tda362-simple-project](https://gitlab.com/chalmerscg/tda362-simple-project).

This branch has no external dependency on CGAL, and thus only includes the non boolean parts of the project.
